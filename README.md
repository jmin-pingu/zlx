# zlx: a Zig implementation of the lox programming language


# todo
- [ ] Need to improve structure (naming, modules, and organization). 
- [ ] KEY: Need to improve error tooling, messaging, and handling.
- [ ] KEY: need to reason about interfaces
- [ ] Need to better actively think about memory management
- [ ] Need to better think about runtime v. comptime
- [ ] Figure out Zig build system.
- [ ] Fuck. Needed to rewrite this so tests are easily expandable.

# questions
- Is the Visitor pattern really necessary? How would I implement this OOP like framework in Zig?
